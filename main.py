Key Catalysts – Professional Investor View
	•	AI Infrastructure Demand Acceleration
Rising hyperscale data center buildouts (driven by AI training/inference) require higher-efficiency power delivery; Infineon is positioned to capture above-market growth in high-voltage, high-efficiency power semiconductors.
	•	EV & xEV Content Growth
Despite near-term EV unit volatility, silicon carbide (SiC) and advanced MOSFET content per vehicle continues to increase, supporting mid-single digit annual content CAGR in the Automotive segment.
	•	Industrial Electrification & Grid Modernization
Structural demand from renewables, energy storage, and industrial automation offsets cyclical softness; Green Industrial Power segment has direct leverage to solar/wind inverter expansion and high-voltage grid infrastructure upgrades.
	•	Capacity Expansion with State-Backed Funding
Dresden Smart Power Fab (€5 bn total investment; €920 m in approved German/EU subsidies) adds strategic 300 mm capacity in Europe, de-risking geopolitical supply risk and enabling scale efficiencies from 2026 onward.
	•	Secured SiC Supply & Technology Transition
Multi-year wafer supply agreements (Wolfspeed, SK Siltron, etc.) ensure substrate availability through the 200 mm SiC transition, providing a cost and yield advantage versus peers still on 150 mm.
	•	Margin Recovery & Operating Leverage
FY25 segment margin guidance raised to high-teens following Q3 beat; mix improvement (auto + AI power) plus capex discipline (FY25E ~€2.2 bn vs prior >€2.4 bn) supports free cash flow improvement in FY26+.
