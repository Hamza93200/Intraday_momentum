	•	Global leadership: #1 in power semiconductors and automotive by share (Omdia references in IR materials).  ￼

Why long IFX — the thesis in 6 bullets
	1.	Power semis are structural, not cyclical. Content growth across EVs, renewables, industrial automation, and AI data-centers raises unit value per end-system. Infineon is top-tier in Si/SiC/GaN power devices + MCUs.  ￼ ￼
	2.	AI data-center power is a new S-curve. Partnership with NVIDIA to shift DC distribution to 800 V/HVDC and centralized architectures → higher dollar content per rack; Company roadmaps include next-gen BBUs (up to 12 kW) and PSU solutions.  ￼ ￼
	3.	Wide-bandgap (SiC/GaN) scale advantage. Ramping 200 mm SiC (Villach/Kulim) with first products released; Kulim 3 targeted as world’s largest SiC fab; multiple long-term wafer supply agreements (Wolfspeed, SK Siltron, others) de-risk capacity.  ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
	4.	Capacity, nearshoring, and subsidy tailwinds. Dresden Smart Power Fab (300 mm) funded under the EU Chips Act: €920m German aid approved by the EU; final national approval granted May 2025. Startup 2026; multi-year ramp.  ￼ ￼
	5.	Improving FY25 profitability. After inventory digestion, IFX raised margin outlook to high-teens on strong Q3 execution; near-term revenue flat to slightly down but mix improving (auto & AI/PSU).  ￼
	6.	Reasonable valuation for a structural grower. Mid-teens margin, LT growth vectors (EVs/renewables/AI power) at ~18–19x forward P/E looks attractive vs peers with similar secular exposure.  ￼

Business & segments (use as “what we do” slides)
	•	Automotive (ATV): e-powertrain (Si/SiC), body & comfort, ADAS MCUs, sensors. Largest revenue share.  ￼
	•	Green Industrial Power (GIP): drives, renewables (PV, wind), energy infrastructure, traction.  ￼
	•	Power & Sensor Systems (PSS): power discretes/ICs & sensors for consumer/comp/PSUs (AI servers).  ￼
	•	Connected Secure Systems (CSS): MCUs, IoT connectivity, security (TPMs/eSIM, etc.).  ￼

Financials (copy to “scorecard” slide)
	•	FY2024: Revenue €14.96bn; strong margin base; all four segments contributed.  ￼
	•	Q1 FY25 (Dec-24): Revenue €3.424bn, segment result €573m, margin 16.7%.  ￼
	•	Q2 FY25 (Mar-25): Revenue growth “as expected”; operational commentary consistent with stabilization.  ￼
	•	Q3 FY25 (Jun-25): Revenue €3.70bn, 18% segment margin; FY25 margin raised to high-teens; FY25 capex trimmed to ~€2.2bn.  ￼
	•	Balance sheet & scale: Market cap ~€47–48bn (IFX.DE); EV ~€51bn; Fwd P/E ~18–19x (Yahoo Finance).  ￼ ￼

Capacity & manufacturing footprint (maps/visual slide)
	•	Dresden “Smart Power Fab” (300 mm): EU Chips Act €920m state-aid approval (Feb 2025); German government final approval May 2025; opening 2026, full capacity by early 2030s.  ￼ ￼
	•	Kulim 3 (Malaysia) + Villach (Austria): “One Virtual Fab” for SiC/GaN; 200 mm SiC in production ramp; first 200 mm SiC products released 1Q25.  ￼ ￼
	•	Portfolio optimization: Sold Austin (200 mm) fab to SkyWater with supply agreement (2025).  ￼
	•	ESMC JV (TSMC, Bosch, NXP, Infineon) in Dresden (logic for auto): separate from IFX Smart Power Fab; mass production planned 2027. Use for ecosystem slide.  ￼

Technology & product catalysts (put next to thesis)
	•	SiC transition to 200 mm → cost & yield scale vs 150 mm peers.  ￼
	•	Long-term wafer agreements (Wolfspeed, SK Siltron, others) secure substrate supply for SiC ramp.  ￼ ￼
	•	AI power delivery: NVIDIA collaboration on HVDC architectures; BBU/PSU roadmaps; “No AI without power” investor deck.  ￼ ￼

Market position & share (quick slide)
	•	Power semiconductors: IFX holds leading share globally per Omdia (referenced by IFX IR).  ￼
	•	Microcontrollers: Omdia cited IFX as #1 MCU share in 2024 (21.3%). Use cautiously (secondary source).  ￼

Guidance & outlook talking points (for “what to expect” slide)
	•	FY2025: Slightly lower revenue vs FY2024 but profitability improved (high-teens margin) amid mix recovery, tariff clarity, and better inventory.  ￼ ￼
	•	Q4 FY25 (Sep-quarter) outlook: revenue guide ~€3.9bn; margin high-teens.  ￼
	•	Capex discipline: FY25 capex revised to ~€2.2bn while continuing strategic fab builds.  ￼

Valuation snapshot (1 slide)
	•	Market cap: ~€47–48bn (IFX.DE) / ~$55–56bn (IFNNY).  ￼ ￼
	•	Forward P/E: ~18–19x (Yahoo Finance, Aug 14–15, 2025).  ￼
	•	P/S (TTM): ~3.2–3.5x (CompaniesMarketCap). (Cross-check with your data provider.)  ￼
	•	Context: Multiple appropriate for secular power semi leader with WBG optionality; peers (STM, onsemi) trade in mid- to high-teens forward P/E ranges (check current prints before presenting).

Customers & partnerships (logo slide ideas)
	•	Stellantis strategic collaboration incl. SiC supply/capacity (EV power network).  ￼
	•	NVIDIA (AI data-center power).  ￼
	•	Substrate partners: Wolfspeed, SK Siltron, others (for SiC wafers).  ￼ ￼

Risks (be explicit on a dedicated slide)
	•	EV volatility: Softer near-term EV demand can pressure ATV growth/mix. (Company guided auto “slightly down” earlier in FY25 commentary.)  ￼
	•	Execution on SiC ramp: Yield/wafer supply risks in 200 mm transition; dependence on third-party wafer contracts.  ￼ ￼
	•	Tariffs/geopolitics & FX: Prior uncertainty now eased somewhat for EU-US tariffs, but policy risk remains.  ￼
	•	Capex intensity: Dresden/Kulim buildouts require multi-year spend; subsidy timing/amount affects IRR (though approvals are secured).  ￼ ￼

Catalysts (near & medium term)
	•	Q4 FY25 print & FY2026 guide (margin trajectory, AI/PSU contribution).  ￼
	•	SiC 200 mm product ramps; more design-wins in EV inverters/charging & renewables.  ￼
	•	AI power architecture wins (HVDC, BBU deployments with hyperscalers).  ￼
	•	Dresden Smart Power Fab milestones (tool move-in/initial output 2026).  ￼

ESG (one slide)
	•	IFX positions power semis as CO₂-savings enabler (PV, EV, efficient PSUs). Annual & “At a glance FY2024” materials detail methodology and environmental targets.  ￼

“Why I will go long” — 5-line narrative you can read out
	•	Dominant in the right markets: #1 in power semis with deep auto & industrial roots; those end-markets are structurally growing.  ￼
	•	New S-curve from AI power: IFX’s partnership with NVIDIA and dedicated BBU/PSU roadmaps make it a key picks-and-shovels supplier to AI data-centers.  ￼ ￼
	•	WBG scale moat: Industry-leading 200 mm SiC ramp and multi-sourced wafers reduce supply risk and improve cost curve.  ￼ ￼
	•	Capacity + subsidies: EU-backed Dresden fab strengthens European supply resilience and supports long-term growth with public co-funding.  ￼
	•	Valuation fair for secular growth: ~18–19x forward earnings for a franchise with high-teens margins and multi-year catalysts (AI/EV/renewables) looks compelling.  ￼
